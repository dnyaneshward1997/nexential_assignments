Q1. We want to store the information about different
vehicles. Create a class named Vehicle with two data members named mileage and
price. Create its two subclasses *Car with data members to store ownership
cost, warranty (by years), seating capacity, and fuel type (diesel or petrol).
*Bike with data members to store the number of cylinders, number of gears,
cooling type(air, liquid, or oil), wheel type(alloys or spokes), and fuel tank
size(in inches) Make another two subclasses Audi and Ford of


Make another two subclasses Audi and Ford of Car,
each having a data member to store the model type. Next, make two subclasses
Bajaj and TVS, each having a data member to store the make-type. Now, store and
print the information of an Audi and a Ford car (i.e. model type, ownership
cost, warranty, seating capacity, fuel type, mileage, and price.) Do the same
for a Bajaj and a TVS bike.





Q2. We have to calculate the area of a rectangle, a
square and a circle. Create an abstract class 'Shape' with three abstract
methods namely 'RectangleArea' taking two parameters, 'SquareArea' and
'CircleArea' taking one parameter each. The parameters of 'RectangleArea' are
its length and breadth, that of 'SquareArea' is its side and that of
'CircleArea' is its radius. Now create another class 'Area' containing all the
three methods 'RectangleArea', 'SquareArea' and 'CircleArea' for printing the


the area of rectangle, square and circle respectively.
Create an object of class 'Area' and call all the three methods.

Q3. Create a class named 'Member' having the following members:Data members
1 - Name
2 - Age
3 - Phone number
4 - Address
5 - Salary
It also has a method named 'printSalary' which prints the salary of the members.
Two classes 'Employee' and 'Manager' inherits the 'Member' class. The 'Employee' and 'Manager' classes have data members 'specialization' and 'department' respectively. 
Now, assign name, age, phone number, address and salary to an employee and a manager by making an object of both of these classes and print the same.

Q4. Create a class named 'Rectangle' with two data members 'length' and 'breadth' and two methods to print the area and perimeter of the rectangle respectively. 
Its constructor having parameters for length and breadth is used to initialize length and breadth of the rectangle. 
Let class 'Square' inherit the 'Rectangle' class with its constructor having a parameter for its side (suppose s) calling the constructor of its parent class as 'super(s,s)'.
Print the area and perimeter of a rectangle and a square.


Q5. Create an abstract class 'Bank' with an abstract method 'getBalance'. 
$100, $150 and $200 are deposited in banks A, B and C respectively. 
'BankA', 'BankB' and 'BankC' are subclasses of class 'Bank', each having a method named 'getBalance'. 
Call this method by creating an object of each of the three classes.

 Let’s try to solve some of the real time queries faced in the Employee Management
System using Java 8 features.
 We will be using following Employee class and employeeList as example while
solving the queries.

class Employee {
    int id;
    String name;
    int age;
    String gender;
    String department;
    int yearOfJoining;
    double salary;
}

Let’s take two classes, Employee and Department.
public class Employee {
  
 private String name;
  
 private Integer age;
  
 private String city;
  
 private Department department;
  
 public Employee(String name, Integer age, String city, Department
department) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
    this.city = city;
    this.department = department;
 }
}

public class Department {
 
 private String departmentName;
  
 private Integer noOfEmployees;
 
 public Department(String departmentName, Integer noOfEmployees) {
      this.departmentName = departmentName;
      this.noOfEmployees = noOfEmployees;
 }
}
some sample data set as follows. We have four departments and set of employees from those
departments.
1. Account, 75
2. HR, 50
3. OP, 25
4. Tech, 150
employee List
1. (&quot;David&quot;, 32, &quot;Matara&quot;, account),
2. (&quot;Brayan&quot;, 25, &quot;Galle&quot;, hr),
3. (&quot;JoAnne&quot;, 45, &quot;Negombo&quot;, ops),
4. (&quot;Jake&quot;, 65, &quot;Galle&quot;, hr),
5. (&quot;Brent&quot;, 55, &quot;Matara&quot;, hr),
6. (&quot;Allice&quot;, 23, &quot;Matara&quot;, ops),
7. (&quot;Austin&quot;, 30, &quot;Negombo&quot;, tech),
8. (&quot;Gerry&quot;, 29, &quot;Matara&quot;, tech),

9. (&quot;Scote&quot;, 20, &quot;Negombo&quot;, ops),
10. (&quot;Branden&quot;, 32, &quot;Matara&quot;, account),
11. (&quot;Iflias&quot;, 31, &quot;Galle&quot;, hr));
1. Find all employees who lives in ‘Matara’ city, sort them by their name and print the names
of employees.
2. Find distinct department names that employees work for.
3. Find the department names that these employees work for, where the number of
employees in the department is over 50.
4. Create a comma separate string of department names sorted alphabetically.
5. Are there any employees from HR Department?
6. Print all employee’s name who are working for account department.
7. What is the highest number of of employees in all departments?
8. Find the department which has the highest number of employees.
9. The same thing can be done as follows using the max() method.
10. Find the total number of employees in all the departments.
11. sorted data in ascending and descending order based on age, city
